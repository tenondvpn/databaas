		<h2>About</h2>
		<p>Liviz.js is a DHTML based &ldquo;dot&rdquo; tool of GraphViz. See <a href="http://www.graphviz.org/About.php">GraphViz.org</a> for more about dot langage.
		<br /><img src="gvintro.png" alt="dot language and graph image" /><br />
		To get started, write dot code above and click <img alt="go" src="../images/gobutton.png" /> button.</p>

		<h3>Limitations</h3>
		<p>Core algorhythm is ported from original GraphViz using Emscripten so that Liviz.js accepts full set of dot langauge. But <em>renderer implementation is tiny so most of decoration will not be drawn</em>.</p>

		<h3>Source Code</h3>
		<p>Liviz.js modifies some parts of GraphViz but they are hell of ugly makefiles and bad hacks now. So please wait while cleaning... (If you want to see anyway, tell me on <a href="http://twitter.com/ushiroad">twitter</a>)</p>
